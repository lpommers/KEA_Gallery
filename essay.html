	<h2>Module 3A: A Dynamic Web Gallery</h2>

	<p class = 'doc_p'>The Gallery is asymmetrical according to the way that photos are displayed and in the Upload page the text is balanced. The color scheme of the gallery is soft so the user can be able to read the text in the two different colors (black and red for error messages), the hover in the button is white so the user knows where is he/she going to click on.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>The Gallery has consistency, for example same typography in all the gallery, except the logo so the user can see and notice directly what the site is about, the pictures are display in different sizes so the gallery can be attractive to the user, all the images raise up slightly when the user wants to open a specific photo and see it bigger or see details of the photo. Same type of font in the upload and gallery button, and they both appear in the same position in the window. </p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>The navigation is simple and basic with the upload, gallery and submit photo. When they click upload picture then the form will appear and after the photo is selected they just have to click submit and with the gallery photo go back to the homepage.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>To this gallery we have included some information like the documentation, and the essay so the user can read more about how the gallery and how has been created so far and some topics about what kind of errors they can expect in the site, and some important information for the user to know.  This information is in html and linked to the site so the user can notice that this information is part of the gallery.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>Some of the things that we were thinking when creating this gallery and that are very important so the user knows what kind of gallery is and so we don’t deal with information and pictures we don’t want in the gallery is the following examples:</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>For example unacceptable information in the gallery:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Nudity, racism, violence in the pictures, showing people being hurt, attacked or humiliated.</li>
		<li>Let know others personal information or invading the privacy of other users, bad behaviour, harassment etc..</li>
		<li>Don’t create links to other sites when filling the upload form, everyone hates spam.</li>
		<li>Comments or hate speech, like ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation etc. Everyone has the right to express free with the condition to not offend others.</li>
		<li>Pictures promoting the use of alcohol or tobacco, or influence the user to consume them. </li>
		<li>Pictures promoting products, selling things or using the gallery as a channel to advertise products.</li>
		<li>Pictures promoting sects, cults etc. for example: dark magic, offer methods, curses, spells …</li>
		<li>Pictures promoting or comments influencing the user to gamble </li>
		<li>Pornography of any kind showing on the pictures.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class = 'doc_p'>Of course it is difficult to please the user all the time and there might be a picture that may not seem offensive to one person but to others it is. For example controversial pictures that show violence or strong ideas but are not in pro of the action or the idea that is behind the picture. For example: war pictures, or pictures that show strong ideas but they are meant not to agree with the problem but to remain the viewer about the problems in this present world and make a change or at least provoke a feeling in the viewer to take some action or just talk about it.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>The main purpose of this gallery is to gather all kind of pictures with the help of each user and create a gallery that is attractive, fun and entertainment to see. We hope the gallery to be a source of inspiration with each picture and produce positive thoughts to the user. The gallery is available to users that love photography, paints , art, colors, people, nature, etc.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>This gallery will permit the user to upload photos to the web and make them available to see them every time they want might, and also see pictures of different people around the world.</p>
	<p class = 'doc_p'>The gallery can have a lot of improvements so the user feels comfortable and know what the site is for and how to use it. Some of the following are ideas that might be incorporated to the gallery so its more attractive and fun to use by the user:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>-	Contact between users? , for example: a user get in touch with other user and they have in common car photos.</li>
		<li>-	Maybe create a “side” in the index page with advertisements about conventions or events in photography around the world or tips on how to improve photography techniques.</li>
		<li>-	A log in and password so the user have better track of the pictures he/she has upload so far.</li>
		<li>-	Restrictions when log in to the gallery like , a pop up that comes and say about to confirm that the user is 18 years old.</li>
		<li>-	Interaction with the user and us / chose a month, week winner picture and send a gift to the winner? Or just the privilege to have the picture display as a background or in the side of the gallery for a short time.</li>
		<li>-	Rate the pictures? Giving 5 stars or give points to the pictures</li>
		<li>-	Create a menu with categories so the user can just look for the photos that he/she wants to see. For example : cars, nature, family so in each one would appear photos that has to do with that.</li>
	</ul>
